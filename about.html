<p class="about"> 
    I am a Maker and a Doer—driven by a desire for knowledge, connection, and understanding to make the world 
    around me a better place for myself and others. I have always been a problem-solver and enjoy the detailed 
    process of laying out an issue’s components like a puzzle, looking at them from various angles and using those 
    different perspectives to map out potential paths for moving forward. As I return to work after raising 
    children I am excited to use the skills I have developed in leadership, problem-solving, and relationship-
    building-–as well as my keen attention to detail, technical experience and ability to learn quickly--to build 
    a new career and path for myself.
